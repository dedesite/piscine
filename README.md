# piscine

## WARNING

I see that this repo is often forked... It was not meant to be shared...
Code in it is poorly written and does not respect coding standard (la "norme") needed for the "piscine".
Honestly, I won't base anything on it.
It is made of projects written mostly in a hurry, just to try to understand what Epitech students had to do, but didn't have time to code them properly.
